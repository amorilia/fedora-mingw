No package for Crystalspace.

The SVN checkout of Crystalspace 'just worked' for me (RWMJ on 2008-11-08).
I had to install the Fedora native package 'jam' and then ran:

  mingw32-configure
  jam

A few of the demos seemed to work, although obviously they were very slow
under Wine.

Don't recommend packaging this now, since it barely qualifies as a
'development tool' and has only a narrow userbase.
