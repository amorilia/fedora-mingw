Build order & package notes:

 ( 1) mingw-binutils

      This is just a straight cross-compile of binutils.  It has
      no BuildRequires beyond what is in basic Fedora already.

 ( 2) mingw-bootstrap

      This is NOT a real Fedora package.  Instead it is a BINARY
      package which is just needed first time if you are building
      from scratch.  It contains some Windows binaries and header
      files which are needed to bootstrap everything, and which
      would normally be built by the packages below (specifically
      by mingw-runtime and mingw-w32api).

 ( 3) mingw-gcc

 ( 4) mingw-runtime
 ( 5) mingw-w32api

      Note that once built and installed, these last two replace the
      files built from binaries in mingw-bootstrap.

 ( 6) mingw-zlib

 ( 7) mingw-libgpg-error

 ( 8) mingw-libgcrypt

 ( 9) mingw-gnutls
