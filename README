----------------------------------------------------------------------

We have started the process of reviewing and importing packages into
Fedora.

As each package gets imported into Fedora, we *remove* it from this
repository.  All further adjustments to the package should be done in
Fedora CVS, as with any ordinary Fedora package.

We need more reviewers:

Build everything
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Install mock

 * Install smock (read smock/README)

 * Download source tarballs and put them in each package directory
   (see .hgignore and the specfiles for a list).

 * Run ./build-everything-in-mock.sh

 * Build logs are printed to the screen and saved in 'buildall.log'
