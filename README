----------------------------------------------------------------------

We have started the process of reviewing and importing packages into
Fedora.

As each package gets imported into Fedora, we *remove* it from this
repository.  All further adjustments to the package should be done in
Fedora CVS, as with any ordinary Fedora package.

We need more reviewers:

Build everything
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Install mock

 * Install smock (read smock/README)

 * Download source tarballs and put them in each package directory
   (see .hgignore and the specfiles for a list).

 * Run ./build-everything-in-mock.sh

 * Build logs are printed to the screen and saved in 'buildall.log'

Package notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 ( 1) mingw32-filesystem

      This is the base package containing the filesystem, RPM macros
      and other stuff that everything depends on.  This is a pure
      Fedora RPM with no outside dependencies.

 ( 2) mingw32-binutils

      This is just a straight cross-compile of binutils.  It has
      no BuildRequires beyond what is in basic Fedora already.

 ( 3) mingw32-runtime-bootstrap
 ( 4) mingw32-w32api-bootstrap

      These are NOT real Fedora packages.  Instead they are BINARY
      packages which is just needed first time if you are building
      from scratch.  It contains some Windows binaries and header
      files which are needed to bootstrap everything, and which
      would normally be built by the packages below (specifically
      by mingw32-runtime and mingw32-w32api).

      Note: If you already have MinGW packages installed then you
      should not build this package.

 ( 5) mingw32-gcc

 ( 6) mingw32-runtime
 ( 7) mingw32-w32api

      Note that once built and installed, these last two replace the
      files built from binaries in mingw32-{runtime,w32api}-bootstrap.

Then for the rest, use ./show-build-order.pl which is a script which
works out the correct order to build packages and will display the
list of commands that you have to invoke to do this.

(Note that show-build-order.pl doesn't actually build anything - it
just prints suggested commands).
