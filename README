Build order & package notes:

 (1) mingw-bootstrap

     This is not a real Fedora package.  Instead it is a binary
     package which is just needed first time if you are building
     from scratch.  It contains some Windows binaries and header
     files which are needed to bootstrap everything, and which
     would normally be built by the packages below (specifically
     by mingw-runtime and mingw-w32api).

 (2) mingw-binutils

 (3) mingw-gcc

 (4) mingw-runtime
 (5) mingw-w32api

     Note that once built and installed, these last two replace the
     files built from binaries in mingw-bootstrap.
