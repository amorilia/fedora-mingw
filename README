This repository contains:

 * MinGW SIG packages _before_ they are accepted into Fedora CVS.

 * Any other tools / scripts we need.

Build order & package notes:

 ( 1) mingw-filesystem

      This is the base package containing the filesystem, RPM macros
      and other stuff that everything depends on.  This is a pure
      Fedora RPM with no outside dependencies.

 ( 2) mingw-binutils

      This is just a straight cross-compile of binutils.  It has
      no BuildRequires beyond what is in basic Fedora already.

 ( 3) mingw-runtime-bootstrap
 ( 4) mingw-w32api-bootstrap

      These are NOT real Fedora packages.  Instead they are BINARY
      packages which is just needed first time if you are building
      from scratch.  It contains some Windows binaries and header
      files which are needed to bootstrap everything, and which
      would normally be built by the packages below (specifically
      by mingw-runtime and mingw-w32api).

      Note: If you already have mingw packages installed then you
      should not build this package.

 ( 5) mingw-gcc

 ( 6) mingw-runtime
 ( 7) mingw-w32api

      Note that once built and installed, these last two replace the
      files built from binaries in mingw-{runtime,w32api}-bootstrap.

Then for the rest, use ./show-build-order.pl which is a script which
works out the correct order to build packages and will display the
list of commands that you have to invoke to do this.

(Note that show-build-order.pl doesn't actually build anything - it
just prints suggested commands).
