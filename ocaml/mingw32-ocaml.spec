# Is it noarch? (XXX)
# Answer: yes and no.  In theory it should be, but because we install
# Windows binaries in %{_libdir}, the path is different if built on
# 32 and 64 bit platforms.  We should probably install the binaries
# in /usr/share.
BuildArch:      noarch

BuildRequires:  mingw32-filesystem >= 30
BuildRequires:  mingw32-gcc
BuildRequires:  mingw32-binutils
BuildRequires:  mingw32-flexdll

# These are required so we can use gcc -m32 and link to 32 bit X11:
BuildRequires:  /lib/libgcc_s.so.1
BuildRequires:  /usr/lib/crt1.o
BuildRequires:  /usr/lib/libX11.so

# We need the native Fedora OCaml package (of the precise matching
# version) for several reasons:
# (a) We need /usr/bin/ocamlrun (the bytecode interpreter) in order
# to run our bytecodes such as i686-pc-mingw32-ocamlopt.  Eventually
# shipping native versions of the cross-compiler binaries should
# resolve this.
# (b) We need camlp4 preprocessor, and because of the way this works
# it has to be the camlp4 from the identical version.
Requires:       ocaml-runtime = %{version}
Requires:       ocaml-camlp4-devel = %{version}

# The built program will try to run the cross-compiler and flexdll, so
# these must be runtime requires.
Requires:       mingw32-gcc
Requires:       mingw32-binutils
Requires:       mingw32-flexdll

# i686-pc-mingw32-ocamlmklib tries to run ocamlopt which is probably a
# bug, but requires this (XXX).
Requires:       ocaml


%description
Objective Caml is a high-level, strongly-typed, functional and
object-oriented programming language from the ML family of languages.

This package is an OCaml cross-compiler which runs natively on Fedora
and produces Windows native executables.

%changelog
* Fri Feb 20 2009 Richard W.M. Jones <rjones@redhat.com> - 3.11.0-0.16.beta1
- Rebuild for mingw32-gcc 4.4

* Sun Nov 23 2008 Richard W.M. Jones <rjones@redhat.com> - 3.11.0-0.15.beta1
- Use the proper package naming convention, since '+' etc shouldn't be
  in the name, as per Fedora packaging guidelines.  Note that this won't
  upgrade smoothly, but we don't care because these packages aren't
  officially released yet.  You'll just have to uninstall the old
  package and install the new one.
- Don't ship our own ocamlrun, use the native one instead.
- Require camlp4 utilities.

* Mon Nov 17 2008 Richard W.M. Jones <rjones@redhat.com> - 3.11.0+beta1-14
- Added README.Fedora.

* Sun Nov 16 2008 Richard W.M. Jones <rjones@redhat.com> - 3.11.0+beta1-13
- Build the native compiler as 32 bits even on a 64 bit build
  architecture (because the target, Windows, is 32 bit).  The
  compiler does strength reduction and other optimizations
  internally so we must ensure it uses the same int type.
- Requires libX11-devel.i386 and libgcc.i386.
- Allow the normal dependency generators to run because this
  is a native package.
- Use mingw32 strip to avoid corrupting binaries.

* Sun Nov 16 2008 Richard W.M. Jones <rjones@redhat.com> - 3.11.0+beta1-8
- Install ocamlc.

* Sat Nov 15 2008 Richard W.M. Jones <rjones@redhat.com> - 3.11.0+beta1-7
- Further requirements.

* Sat Nov 15 2008 Richard W.M. Jones <rjones@redhat.com> - 3.11.0+beta1-6
- Install tools, particularly ocamlmklib.

* Sat Nov 15 2008 Richard W.M. Jones <rjones@redhat.com> - 3.11.0+beta1-5
- +Requires mingw32-flexdll and the cross-compiler.

* Sat Nov 15 2008 Richard W.M. Jones <rjones@redhat.com> - 3.11.0+beta1-4
- Initial RPM release.
