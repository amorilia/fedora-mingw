libraries are suitable for eventual standardization. (Some of the
libraries have already been proposed for inclusion in the C++

Bzip2 compresses files to within 10 to 15 percent of the capabilities

of being approximately two times faster at compression and six times 
faster at decompression than those techniques.  Bzip2 is not the 
fastest compression utility, but it does strike a balance between speed 
and compression capability.

This package contains development tools and libraries for use when
cross-compiling Windows software in Fedora.

<tr><td><a title="CrossReport is a tool to help you analyze the APIs used by a compiled
Linux program, in order to work out the effort required to
cross-compile that program for Windows, using the Fedora MinGW
cross-compiler.

The simplest way to use it is to point it at an existing Linux binary,
and then read the generated report.

What it does in more detail: It looks at the libraries and API calls
used by the Linux binary, and compares them to the libraries and API
calls that we currently support under the Fedora MinGW cross-compiler.
It then works out what is missing, and produces a report suggesting
the amount of work that needs to be done to port the program.  For
example, whether whole libraries need to be ported first, and/or how
to substitute individual calls to work on Windows.

<tr><td><a title="Under Windows, DLL (Dynamically-Linked Libraries) are generally used
to improve code modularity and sharing. A DLL can be loaded
automatically when the program is loaded (if it requires the DLL). The
program can also explicitly request Windows to load a DLL at any
moment during runtime, using the LoadLibrary function from the Win32
API.

This naturally suggests to use DLLs as a plugin mechanism. For
instance, a web server could load extensions modules stored in DLLs at
runtime. But Windows does not really make it easy to implement plugins
that way. The reason is that when you try to create a DLL from a set
of object files, the linker needs to resolve all the symbols, which
leads to the very problem solved by FlexDLL:

Windows DLL cannot refer to symbols defined in the main application or
in previously loaded DLLs.

Some usual solutions exist, but they are not very flexible. A notable
exception is the edll library (its homepage also describes the usual
solutions), which follows a rather drastic approach; indeed, edll
implements a new dynamic linker which can directly load object files
(without creating a Windows DLL).

FlexDLL is another solution to the same problem. Contrary to edll, it
relies on the native static and dynamic linkers. Also, it works both
with the Microsoft environment (MS linker, Visual Studio compilers)
and with Cygwin (GNU linker and compilers, in Cygwin or MinGW
mode). Actually, FlexDLL implements mostly the usual dlopen POSIX API,
without trying to be fully conformant though (e.g. it does not respect
the official priority ordering for symbol resolution). This should
make it easy to port applications developed for Unix.

emphasizes speed over simplicity/elegance in its operations.

and implementation makes the C++ Portable Components extremely well
suited for embedded development, an area where the C++ programming
language is becoming increasingly popular, due to its suitability for
both low-level (device I/O, interrupt handlers, etc.) and high-level
object-oriented development. Of course, POCO is also ready for
enterprise-level challenges.

The POCO libraries free developers from re-inventing the wheel, and
allow them to spend their time on more worthwhile areas, such as
getting things done quickly and working on the features that make
their application unique.
