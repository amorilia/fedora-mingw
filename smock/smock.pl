=head1 NAME

 smock - Simpler mock

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 smock.pl --arch=i386 --arch=x86_64 --distro=fedora-10 list of SRPMs ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a wrapper around I<mock> which lets you build a whole group of
mutually dependent SRPMs in one go.

The smock command will work out the correct order in which to build
the SRPMs, and makes the result of previous RPM builds available as
dependencies for later builds.

Smock also works incrementally.  It won't rebuild RPMs which were
built already in a previous run, which means if a package fails to
build, you can just fix it and rerun the same smock command.  (In the
unlikely case that you want to force smock to rebuild RPMs then you
must bump the release number or delete the binary RPM from the
localrepo directory).

B<NOTE:> Please read the README file first.  You need to set up mock
and a web server before you can use this command.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--arch>

Specify the architecture(s) to build, eg. i386, x86_64.  You can
list this option several times to build several architectures.

=item B<--distro>

Specify the distribution(s) to build, eg. fedora-9, fedora-10.
You can list this option several times to build several distributions.

=item B<--localrepo>

Local repository.  Defaults to C<$HOME/public_html/smock/yum>

=item B<--dryrun>

Don't run any commands, just print the packages in the order
in which they must be built.

=item B<--keepgoing>

Don't exit if a package fails, but keep building.

Note that this isn't always safe because new packages may be built
against older packages, in the case where the older package couldn't
be rebuilt because of an error.

However, it is very useful.

=item B<--chain>

Don't run any commands, just print the packages in the correct
format for chain building.  See:
L<http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Koji/UsingKoji#Chained_builds>
