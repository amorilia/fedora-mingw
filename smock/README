 SMOCK - Simpler Mock
 ====================

Smock is a thin wrapper around mock to let you build up a whole
set of dependant RPMs against an external distro.

 - Copy smock.httpd.conf to /etc/httpd/conf.d/smock.conf, changing the
   /home/[USERNAME]/ to your user
 - Start httpd
 - Add  smock.mock.conf to all your repos in /etc/mock/ changing the
   arch and distro name to match
 - Create  $HOME/smock

 - Edit smock.sh to set which arch(es) you want to build on

Now you can run

    ./smock.sh fedora-9 /path/to/srpm

And it'll build  the RPM against the fedora-9-XXX distro for each 'XXX' 
arch you listed.

The resulting src RPMs, binary RPMs and build logs wil be put into
$HOME/smock, and a YUM repo created. Further RPMs you build using
smock will resolve the BuildRequires against this local repo
