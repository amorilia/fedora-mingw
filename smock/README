 SMOCK - Simpler Mock
 ====================
by Dan Berrange and Richard W.M. Jones.

Smock is a thin wrapper around mock to let you build up a whole
set of dependant RPMs against an external distro.

 - Create directory $HOME/public_html/smock

 - Copy smock.httpd.conf to /etc/httpd/conf.d/smock.conf, changing the
   /home/[USERNAME]/ to your user

 - Start or restart httpd

 - Insert smock.mock.extra to all your repos in /etc/mock/ changing the
   USERNAME, arch and distro name to match

 - Disable SELinux (/usr/sbin/setenforce Permissive) and you may
   need to do 'chmod 0755 ~' to allow the web server to access your
   home directory.

Now you can run

    ./smock.pl --arch=i386 --arch=x86_64 --distro=fedora-9 list of srpms

And it'll build the all the SRPMs listed on the command line, using
previously built SRPMs as dependencies for later ones.  You don't need
to list them in the proper order - the build order is worked out using
the dependencies.

The resulting src RPMs, binary RPMs and build logs wil be put into
$HOME/public_html/smock, and a Yum repo created.  Further RPMs you
build using smock will resolve the BuildRequires against this local
repo.
