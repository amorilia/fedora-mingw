 SMOCK - Simpler Mock
 ====================

Smock is a thin wrapper around mock to let you build up a whole
set of dependant RPMs against an external distro.

 - Create directory $HOME/public_html/smock

 - Copy smock.httpd.conf to /etc/httpd/conf.d/smock.conf, changing the
   /home/[USERNAME]/ to your user

 - Start or restart httpd

 - Insert smock.mock.extra to all your repos in /etc/mock/ changing the
   USERNAME, arch and distro name to match

 - Disable SELinux (/usr/sbin/setenforce Permissive) and you may
   need to do 'chmod 0755 ~' to allow the web server to access your
   home directory.

Now you can run

    ./smock.sh fedora-9 /path/to/srpm

And it'll build the RPM against the fedora-9-XXX distro for each 'XXX'
arch you listed.

The resulting src RPMs, binary RPMs and build logs wil be put into
$HOME/public_html/smock, and a Yum repo created.  Further RPMs you
build using smock will resolve the BuildRequires against this local
repo.
