A tool to compare mingw specfiles against the native specfiles
and report on meaningful details that we should fix to keep
mingw in sync with native builds.

It expects that $HOME/src/fedora/ contains a checkout of all
matching Fedora modules

There are some bogus warnings due to mingw specific things
but need to be filtered / surpressed on a case by case basis
cf valgrind's  --suppression arg

NB, this requires a patched rpm-python
