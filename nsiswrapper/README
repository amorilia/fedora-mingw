NSISWrapper is a helper program for making Windows installers,
particularly when you are cross-compiling from Unix.

NSIS (a separate package) is a program for building Windows
installers.  This wrapper simply makes it easier to generate the
installer script that NSIS needs.

You can get NSIS itself from http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ but
generally speaking this wrapper is only useful when cross-compiling
(run from a Linux machine) in which case you should use the Fedora or
Debian version of NSIS from:

  Fedora:  http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/MinGW
  Debian:  http://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/nsis

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NSISWrapper requires a reasonably recent version of Perl.  You will
also need to install the MinGW cross-compiler binutils
(mingw32-binutils package).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

For usage instructions, please refer to the manual page nsiswrapper(1).
If for some reason the manual page isn't installed then you can do
this instead:

  nsiswrapper --man

For help with NSIS itself, please refer to the NSIS website.

You can also get quick command line help by doing:

  nsiswrapper --help
