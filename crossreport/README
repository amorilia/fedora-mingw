CrossReport is a tool which developers can run against their Linux
binaries, which analyzes the APIs those binaries are using, and
estimates how difficult it will be to cross-compile the binaries for
Windows (using Fedora MinGW).

This tool was written by Richard W.M. Jones (rjones@redhat.com).

Use 'mingw32-crossreport --help' for instructions, or read the man page.

Use 'update-crossreport-db.pl' to update the database file.  *NOTE* you
should have all the mingw32-* packages installed on the current
machine when you run this.  So:

  # yum install mingw32-*
  $ ./update-crossreport-db.pl
