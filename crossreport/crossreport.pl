=head1 NAME

CrossReport - Analysis tool to help cross-compilation to Windows.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 mingw32-crossreport [options] /path/to/linuxbinary

=head1 DESCRIPTION

CrossReport is a tool to help you analyze the APIs used by a compiled
Linux program, in order to work out the effort required to
cross-compile that program for Windows, using the Fedora MinGW
cross-compiler.

The simplest way to use it is to point it at an existing Linux binary,
and then read the generated report.

What it does in more detail: It looks at the libraries and API calls
used by the Linux binary, and compares them to the libraries and API
calls that we currently support under the Fedora MinGW cross-compiler.
It then works out what is missing, and produces a report suggesting
the amount of work that needs to be done to port the program.  For
example, whether whole libraries need to be ported first, and/or how
to substitute individual calls to work on Windows.

=head1 EXAMPLE

Assuming that the excellent vector graphics editor Inkscape
(L<http://www.inkscape.org/>) is installed, you could do:

 mingw32-crossreport /usr/bin/inkscape > inkscape-report.txt
 less inkscape-report.txt

=head1 SHORTCOMINGS

The report is only a general guide.  CrossReport contains a lot of
knowledge about common Linux calls and APIs, but does not know about
every possible library.

=head1 DATABASE

The program relies on a database of MinGW APIs.  The default location
for this database is C</usr/share/crossreport/crossreport.db> or the
same file in the current working directory.  If the database cannot be
found in either location, the program will fail with an error message.

The database is updated regularly and distributed with CrossReport.
To get the best quality report, make sure you are running a recent
version of the program.
