The ../gnutls directory contains a full spec file for a separate
mingw-gnutls package.

In this directory is the original gnutls spec file from Fedora, and
modified with an extra subpackage for mingw, so you can diff the two
to find the 'mingw fragment' that the gnutls maintainer would need to
add.
